# Android ANT Services and Tools
The included services are applications that run in the background which allow communication between apps and the ANT hardware. ANT Radio Service acts as a driver, controlling the chip, managing channels handed out to applications, and handling features such as background scanning. These services are available for download through the Play Store and may be pre-installed by device manufacturers.
